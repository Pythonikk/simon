# Simon

Simon is a very simple reproduction of the classic handheld electronic memory game, 'Simon'. The player copies the pattern output by Simon in rounds of increasing length. 

## Version 1

Speed and pattern incrementation can be increased with the diffculty feature.


## Next Update

The tones from synth.js should not sound in conjunction with the mp3.
